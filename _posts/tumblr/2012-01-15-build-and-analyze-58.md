DB: [Power Grid, by Rio Grande Games](http://www.amazon.com/Rio-Grande-Games-
RGG240-Power/dp/B0007YDBLE).

MA: Yeah, very good. The whole family enjoyed it. I think this is the first
relatively complex game that … none of us knew how to play it and we learned
it by reading instructions, not by like having somebody teach us..

DB: (laughter) I'm sorry, there's a picture on the Amazon page where people
can upload their own images, [there's a picture](http://www.amazon.com/gp
/customer-media/product-
gallery/B0007YDBLE/ref=cm_ciu_pdp_images_0?ie=UTF8&index=0) of what looks like
a family playing it, and the family looks completely bored out of their mind.
I'm going to try this URL in the show notes…

MA: Oh you're right, red shirt on the left?

DB: Yeah.

MA: Oh my God.

DB: That's a great picture.
