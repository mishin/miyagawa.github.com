Here's a quick (big) announcement: I'm parting ways with
[DotCloud](https://www.dotcloud.com/) and will join
[COOKPAD](http://cookpad.com/) in February.

As for DotCloud, It's been an interesting ride for me at 180 Sansome and I
will definitely miss working with them, and wish the best luck at their
challenge to be the best platform as a service. My last day at DotCloud is
1/31.

On February 1st, I will join COOKPAD, Inc. to work full-time as a senior
developer. COOKPAD may not need any introduction for any Japanese audience,
since it is everyone's favorite recipe sharing website. Here's [a quick intro
about the company](http://info.cookpad.com/en) in English.

As a weekend chef, I use the site a lot myself, and am thrilled to join the
company to contribute to the growth. The company is Tokyo-based (with its
lovely headquarters in Shirokanedai) but **I will continue my life in San
Francisco** and will see my friends more often in my occasional visits to
Tokyo.

I'm really excited to work with brilliant folks from COOKPAD, most notably the
founder Aki Sano, and [Daisuke Horie](https://twitter.com/dice), who I enjoyed
working with at Six Apart, along with very talented engineers in the team.
(Oh, and I heard [they're hiring](http://info.cookpad.com/en/jobs/open-
positions) :D)

Exciting times!
