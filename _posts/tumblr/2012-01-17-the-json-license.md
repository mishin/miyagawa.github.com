[The JSON license](http://www.json.org/license.html)

I was looking at the acknowledgement screen of Apple TV today and found that
[the JSON license](http://www.json.org/license.html) is there and includes the
following text:

> The Software shall be used for Good, not Evil.

a) is this license (for JSON.org parser I assume) compatible to OSI? I guess
not.

b) isn't Apple doing anything evil? Who decides what is evil anyways?

Quick google search shows the same question on
[Quora](http://www.quora.com/JSON/How-does-one-comply-with-the-JSON-Open-
Source-license-terms-regarding-Good-not-Evil).
