**UPDATE**: [I did more experiments with configuration tweaks](http://weblog.bulknews.net/2012/01/08/gx1-jpeg-output-update).

I got [Panasonic Lumix GX1](http://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0064U2BBQ/bulknews-22)
from amazon.co.jp (order placed on 12/31 and received the item on 1/1 - that's
an amazing logistics in Japan).

I love the performance of this camera and there's tons of improvements over
GF1, especially the horizontal meter, EXIF orientation and touch to focus ala
iPhone cameras.

However, one thing I still don't get used to is its high ISO preference and
colors under the room light. Compare these shots (GF1 -> GX1 order)

All photos taken with "standard" color settings and saved in JPEG (I know
colors are not problems when you shoot RAW - I'm too lazy for that)

Simply put, to my eyes, GF1's auto white balance produces more natural colors
than GX1. It may not be what you feel, because over the internet forums,
people seem to say GF1 produces more "yellow" colors and GX1 seems to have
"fixed" it.

GX1's auto white balance by default makes human's skin color more red under
the room light. With the "Tungsten" white balance configuration, the color
gets more natural, and that's probably an improvement. However the output
looks like a very "light" touched photo to me - it may be because of its high
ISO tendency.

GX1Â [does very nice job about high ISO
processing](http://www.stevehuffphoto.com/2011/12/29/panasonic-gx1-vs-
olympus-e-p3-part-1-basics-and-high-iso/) but it _always_ tries to take shots
with high ISO, even under a reasonable amount of light. The default maximum
ISO setting is set to 1600 - this may be a bit higher than optimal. I set it
to 800 for now and see what comes out.
