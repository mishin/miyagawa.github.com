[Kindle Touch compared to Nook Simple Touch, Kobo Touch, and Kindle 4 –

kobo-touch-kindle-4)

A thorough review on e-Ink touch readers from Marco.

> But Instapaper on Kindles isn’t perfect. I’ve been able to generate
newspaper-style navigation that works on all non-touch Kindles, but the Kindle
Touch and Kindle Fire use new periodical-navigation formats that I haven’t
been able to successfully generate yet. I don’t know if Amazon will ever make
this possible. And recent changes to Kindle “personal document” storage makes
it difficult to delete old Instapaper articles from the Kindle Touch.

I don't actually see any issues with its performance of Kindle Touch. There's
definitely a lag after clicking home screen, and opening a new book, but
otherwise page turns are reasonably fast for me.

However, as pointed out, the lack of periodicals support and being unable to
delete/archive these documents on the device is really frustrating. I hope
Amazon fixes this, along with performance improvements, in the future software
updates.
