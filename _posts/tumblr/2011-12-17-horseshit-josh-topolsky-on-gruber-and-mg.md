[Horseshit (Josh Topolsky on Gruber and

> 5: "You either see it or you don't." The world is not black and white. It's
really, really gray. You can see it and not care. You can see it and love it.
You can see it and hate it. You can see it but need something else. You can
see it, and yet see other things too.

Quite needless to say, I'm with Topolsky on this one. I see the difference
between iOS and Android - I have iPad, Mac mini, Apple TV and Macbook Air for
all the computer needs and I think iOS is the most intuitive, beautiful, easy
to use mobile OS, and yet my phone is Android.

I appreciate the control on my own phone, an ability to customize it as much
as I like, and I encourage the differences and alternatives, even if it is not
the _best_ .
